# opus2_portfolio

## Description 

This project is to make three pages for a portfolio. Though all three pages have different content, they all needed to have certain elements the same. These are:

    1. A navigation bar at the top of each page.
    2. A layout that is responsive to the screen that the page is being viewed on
    3. Images that are also responsive
    4. An optional element is a sticky footer to the bottom of the page

The content of the pages are:

    1. An About Me page
    2. The portfolio itself
    3. A contact page
